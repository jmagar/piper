**Files Modified:**
- `lib/sync/background-sync.ts`

**Changes Implemented:**
- ✅ Fixed MessageChannel resource leaks in `getSyncStatus`
- ✅ Added proper cleanup and timeout handling
- ✅ Improved error handling in message sending with detailed error logging
- ✅ Better race condition prevention with proper flag management

**Impact:** Prevents memory leaks and improves reliability of background sync operations.

### 8. Prisma Connection Pool Configuration (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COMPLETED)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/prisma.ts`

**Changes Implemented:**
- ✅ Enhanced PrismaClient configuration with logging
- ✅ Added graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Implemented connection monitoring utilities (`getPrismaMetrics`, `testDatabaseConnection`)
- ✅ Proper process event handling for cleanup
- ✅ Environment-aware logging configuration

**Impact:** Better resource management and monitoring capabilities for database connections.

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented Fixes

### Error Boundaries for React Providers
**Status:** Attempted but skipped due to React type definition issues
**Alternative:** Enhanced error handling directly in providers instead

### Safe State Management Hooks  
**Status:** Attempted but skipped due to React type definition issues
**Alternative:** Improved existing state management with better error handling
