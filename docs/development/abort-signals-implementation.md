# Abort Signals - Deprecated

This document is now deprecated. The Abort Controller system has been removed from the Enhanced MCP Client due to issues with false abort triggers.

The client's modular structure is now located in `lib/mcp/enhanced/`. Please refer to the new documentation at [`lib/mcp/enhanced/README.md`](./lib/mcp/enhanced/README.md) for the latest information on the Enhanced MCP Client architecture and usage.
