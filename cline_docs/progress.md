# Progress: Debugging MCP Tool Invocation

## What Works

-   **MCP Server Discovery & Initialization:** `mcpManager` can discover MCP servers from `config.json` and initialize `MCPService` instances for them.
-   **Tool Definition Fetching & Schema Processing:** `MCPService` can fetch tool definitions from MCP servers. `mcpManager` processes these schemas (including `jsonSchema` wrapping) for the Vercel AI SDK.
-   **AI Model Generates Tool Call Requests:** The AI model (via Vercel AI SDK) correctly identifies when to use a tool and generates the appropriate tool call structure.
-   **`MCPService.invokeTool` Method Implemented:**
    *   The `invokeTool(toolName, args)` method has been successfully added to `lib/mcp/client.ts`.
    *   It includes logic to wait for client initialization, check client status, and (critically) attempt to call `this.mcpClient.invoke(toolName, args)`.
    *   Contains logging to help diagnose the presence and behavior of `this.mcpClient.invoke`.
-   **Tool `execute` Method in `mcpManager`:**
    *   Tool definitions passed to the Vercel AI SDK by `mcpManager` now include an `async execute(args)` method.
    *   This `execute` method is designed to call `mcpServiceInstance.invokeTool(this.toolName, args)`, bridging the AI SDK to our `MCPService`.
-   **Removal of Experimental Handlers:**
    *   The `experimental_repairToolCall` handler has been removed from `app/api/chat/route.ts`.
    *   The system now relies on the `execute` method on tool definitions for tool invocation.

## What's Left to Build/Fix (Immediate Focus)

1.  **Verify `mcpClient.invoke` Existence & Behavior (Runtime Testing):**
    *   **CRITICAL:** Run the application and trigger a tool call. Examine console logs from `MCPService` to confirm if `this.mcpClient` (from `experimental_createMCPClient`) has an `invoke` method and what its actual methods are.
2.  **Resolve `Error [AI_MessageConversionError]: ToolInvocation must have a result`:**
    *   This remains the primary blocker. The current changes (implementing the `execute` -> `invokeTool` -> `mcpClient.invoke` flow) are hypothesized to resolve this. Testing will confirm.
3.  **Address `as any` Casts and Lint Errors in `MCPService.invokeTool`:**
    *   If `mcpClient.invoke` is confirmed, update the type definition for `this.mcpClient` to include it, removing the need for `as any`.
    *   If `invoke` does not exist, these casts will be removed as part of implementing direct communication.
4.  **Implement Fallback if `mcpClient.invoke` is Missing:**
    *   If the runtime check shows `mcpClient.invoke` is not available, modify `MCPService.invokeTool` to directly handle MCP communication based on transport type (e.g., HTTP POST for SSE, or writing to/reading from stdio for local processes).
5.  **Remove Unused `ToolCallPart` Import:**
    *   Successfully remove the `ToolCallPart` import from `app/api/chat/route.ts` (previous attempts failed due to `replace_file_content` target issues).
6.  **End-to-End Testing:** Thoroughly test the chat functionality with various MCP tools to ensure stability and correct result handling.
7.  **Address Other Lint Issues:** Systematically go through and fix remaining lint errors in the codebase once the core tool invocation is stable.

## Progress Status

-   **Significant Progress / Partially Blocked:** Key architectural changes for a new tool invocation pathway are complete. The system is now *theoretically* set up for the Vercel AI SDK to call `tool.execute()`, which in turn calls `MCPService.invokeTool()`, which then attempts `this.mcpClient.invoke()`.
-   **Blocked on:** Runtime verification of `this.mcpClient.invoke`'s existence and behavior. The success of the entire approach hinges on this or the successful implementation of a fallback.

## Key Open Questions

1.  **Does `experimental_createMCPClient`'s returned client object actually possess an `invoke(toolName, args)` method or an equivalent?** What are its true methods and properties (to be answered by runtime logs)?
2.  **Will the new `execute` -> `invokeTool` -> `mcpClient.invoke` flow successfully provide a result to the Vercel AI SDK and resolve the `ToolInvocation must have a result` error?**
3.  If `mcpClient.invoke` is not available, what is the most robust way to implement direct MCP communication within `MCPService.invokeTool` for both SSE and stdio transports?
