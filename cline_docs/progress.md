# Progress: Piper AI Chat Application

**Last Updated**: 2025-05-30T00:39:11-04:00

This document tracks the development progress, highlighting what's working, what's planned, and the overall status.

## âœ… What Works / Key Milestones Achieved

1.  **Core Chat Functionality**: Stable, streaming chat interface with LLM integration (via OpenRouter and Vercel AI SDK).
2.  **MCP Framework Integration**: Robust integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP 2024-11-05 specification).
    *   Successful initialization and management of 19+ diverse MCP servers.
3.  **STDIO MCP Tool Support**: Full support for MCP servers running as local child processes (stdio transport).
    *   ~21+ tools from STDIO servers are operational.
    *   Tools are correctly wrapped and made available to the Vercel AI SDK.
4.  **SSE MCP Tool Support (MAJOR FIX IMPLEMENTED)**:
    *   **Full support for MCP servers communicating via Server-Sent Events (SSE).**
    *   **107 tools from 11 SSE servers are now correctly loaded and fully operational.**
    *   The critical bug preventing SSE tools from being registered with the Vercel AI SDK (due to `transport` object handling in `getCombinedMCPToolsForAISDK`) has been **RESOLVED**.
    *   The AI SDK now transparently handles invocation for these SSE tools.
5.  **Unified Tool Management**: `MCPManager` successfully discovers, initializes, and prepares tools from both STDIO and SSE sources for the Vercel AI SDK.
6.  **Advanced Response Processing**: System for chunking large tool responses (>5KB) and applying tool-specific content processors is in place.
7.  **Caching System**: Redis caching for MCP server status (300s TTL) and periodic health checks (60s interval) is functional, reducing redundant polling.
8.  **Production Docker Deployment**: Stable multi-container Docker setup for Unraid (Piper app, PostgreSQL, Redis).
    *   Optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds.
    *   Correct network configuration for container-to-host communication (using host IP like `10.1.0.2`).
9.  **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration via `config.json` (for MCP servers) and `.env` (for secrets).
10. **Development Experience**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) with state persistence for `MCPManager` to speed up development cycles.
11. **Error Handling & Logging**: Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms are in place for MCP interactions.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Left to Build / Next Steps

1.  **Current Immediate Task**: Finalize and verify this Memory Bank update to ensure all documentation accurately reflects the current system status.
2.  **Post-Update Monitoring**: Thoroughly monitor the production environment after the recent SSE fix to ensure stability and catch any regressions.
3.  **Configuration Validation**: Consider implementing more robust schema validation for `config.json` entries at startup to catch malformed configurations earlier and provide clearer error messages.
4.  **Enhanced Tool-Specific Processors**: While basic chunking is in place, develop more sophisticated processors for common complex tool output types (e.g., detailed JSON, multi-part reports) to improve summarization and presentation to the LLM/user.
5.  **User Interface (UI) Enhancements**: (If applicable based on user feedback or roadmap)
    *   Improved display for complex tool results.
    *   More granular controls for managing MCP services or tools from the UI.
6.  **Expanded Test Coverage**: Increase automated test coverage, especially for the MCP integration layer and various tool invocation scenarios (both STDIO and SSE).
7.  **Documentation Review**: Conduct a full review of all user-facing and developer documentation to ensure it's up-to-date with the latest changes.
8.  **Awaiting New Feature Requests**: Address new features or bug fixes as requested by the USER.

## ðŸ“Š Overall Progress Status

**Status**: **ðŸš€ Significantly Advanced / Major Bugs Resolved**

Piper has reached a new level of stability and functionality with the resolution of the critical SSE tool integration issue. All 128+ configured tools across 19+ MCP servers are now operational and accessible to the AI, fulfilling a core design goal of the application.
The system is robust and deployed in a production-like environment on Unraid.

Future work will likely focus on refinements, new feature development based on user needs, and ongoing maintenance to ensure continued stability and performance.
