# Progress

## What Works

-   **Core Chat Functionality (Admin-Only)**:
    -   Chat interface loads.
    -   Messages can be sent and received via OpenRouter.
    -   Chat history is displayed and accessible.
    -   New chats can be created.
    -   Existing chats can be loaded.
-   **Agent Management (Admin-Only)**:
    -   Agents can be created, viewed, and listed.
    -   Agents can be deleted.
    -   Agent selection in chat UI.
-   **Database & ORM**:
    -   PostgreSQL 16 is running in Docker.
    -   Prisma ORM is integrated for data access (Chat, Message, Agent models).
    -   Prisma migrations are applied automatically on startup.
    -   Foreign key constraint issue between `Chat` and `Message` creation resolved via `upsert` pattern.
-   **Docker Setup**:
    -   `docker-compose.yml` defines `zola-app` and `zola-db` services.
    -   Application builds and starts successfully in Docker.
    -   Persistent data storage via Docker volumes for database and uploads.
-   **Admin-Only Refactor**: Most authentication logic removed. Key components like chat, history, and agent management have been adapted to operate without internal user context.

-   **MCP Client Transport Configuration:**
    -   Successfully initializes MCP clients for both `stdio` and `sse` transport types.
    -   Correctly uses `Experimental_StdioMCPTransport` for `stdio` servers.
    -   Properly infers transport types from `config.json` (command -> stdio, url -> sse).
    -   All configured MCP servers in `config.json` were successfully connected to, and their tools were listed during testing.

## What's Left to Build / Refine

-   **Thorough Testing of Admin-Only Mode**: Verify all features work as expected post-refactor.
    -   Focus on edge cases and potential regressions.
-   **Final Codebase Review for Auth Remnants**: Ensure no legacy authentication logic remains.
-   **Address `userId` in `checkLimitsAndNotify`**: Determine appropriate identifier for rate limiting.
-   **Implement Local File Uploads**: (Next major feature post-refactor stabilization)
    *   Refactor upload logic for local filesystem.
    *   Remove cloud storage restrictions.
    *   Add comprehensive logging.
-   **Database Layer Refactor (Prisma with Postgres) - Finalization**: (Ongoing)
    *   Review and complete any remaining Prisma schema updates (e.g. ensuring all tables/fields align with admin-only model).
    *   Refactor any other data access logic beyond chat messages to use Prisma if necessary.
    *   Thoroughly test all CRUD operations for all models.
-   **Logging Implementation**.
-   **Deployment & Configuration Verification**.
-   **Final Testing**.

## Known Issues / Challenges

-   **Turbopack Instability**: After resolving Prisma client-side bundling issues, switching to `next dev --turbopack` results in a generic "An unexpected Turbopack error occurred" (HTTP 500). The project is currently using Webpack for stability.
-   **CSS Lint Errors**: Persistent, minor CSS lint errors in `app/globals.css` (e.g., `@plugin`, `@custom-variant`) unrelated to core application logic.

## Progress Status

-   **Section 1: Initial Setup & Basic Chat** - Done
-   **Section 2: Remove All Authentication, Multi-User, Cloud, and Real-Time Code (Supabase Removal & Simplification)** - (Nearing completion, extensive refactoring done, testing pending)
-   **Section 3: Implement Local File Uploads** - (Pending completion of Section 2)
-   **Section 4: Database Layer Refactor (Prisma with Postgres)** - (Partially complete, ongoing)
-   **Section 5: Authentication (External via Authelia)** - Configuration/Setup (External, app assumes admin context)
-   **Section 6: Logging Implementation** - Not Started
-   **Section 7: Deployment & Config** - (Docker setup stable, full verification pending)
-   **Section 8: Final Testing** - Not Started
