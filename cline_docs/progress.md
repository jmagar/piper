# Progress: Piper Development Status

**Last Updated**: Current Session (Reflecting logging system Bivvy climb completion)

**Overall Status**: 
- Development environment (`dev.sh`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, Prisma DB sync) is stable.
- CSRF token issue and server-side fetch URL parsing errors have been resolved.
- **Major enhancement completed: MCP Server Dashboard now includes full management capabilities.**
- **New major feature completed: Comprehensive Logging System implemented.**

## What Works / Recently Confirmed:

### âœ… **Development Environment & Database**
   - Docker Setup, Database Synchronization, Environment Variables, Core Infrastructure: All stable.

### âœ… **Server-Side Fetch Calls**
   - `lib/server-fetch.ts` utility operational for absolute URL API calls.
   - CSRF protection appropriately removed.

### âœ… **Chat Creation**
   - Chat creation flow and API route calls are functional.

### âœ… **MCP Server Management (Bivvy Climb p7X2 - COMPLETED)**
   - Enhanced Dashboard Dialog: Full CRUD in `app/components/mcp-servers/mcp-servers-dashboard.tsx`.
   - Unified interface, responsive design, robust error handling.

### âœ… **Comprehensive Logging System (Bivvy Climb x7K2 - COMPLETED)**
   - **Architecture**: Winston-based, structured JSON, daily rotation, correlation IDs.
   - **Core Components**: `lib/logger/index.ts` (main service), `lib/logger/types.ts`, `lib/logger/correlation.ts`, `lib/logger/error-handler.ts`, `lib/logger/mcp-logger.ts`, `lib/logger/ai-sdk-logger.ts`, `lib/logger/security.ts`, `lib/logger/rotation-config.ts`.
   - **Middleware**: `middleware/correlation.ts`, `middleware/logging.ts`, `middleware/error-handler.ts`, integrated into `middleware.ts`.
   - **Specialized Loggers**: For MCP (JSON-RPC, lifecycle, tool performance) and AI SDK (operations, streaming, costs).
   - **Error Handling**: Advanced classification, `AppError` class, global handlers.
   - **Security**: PII detection/masking, access controls (stubs), audit logging.
   - **Log Viewer**: `app/components/log-viewer/index.tsx` with filtering, search, real-time updates.
   - **APIs**: `/api/logs/route.ts` (querying), `/api/logs/export/route.ts` (export), `/api/logs/health/route.ts` (health check).
   - **Admin Integration**: Log viewer in `app/dashboard/manager.tsx`.
   - **Testing & Docs**: Foundational tests and `docs/logging-system.md` created.
   - **Resolved Issues**: Multiple import/export errors and linter issues fixed during implementation.

### âœ… **Previous Stable Items**
   - MCP Configuration Management, SSE MCP Tool Integration.

## What's Left to Build / Immediate Next Focus:

### ðŸš§ **Verify Hot Reloading**
   - Confirm that code changes in the local source directory reflect in the running application without a full container rebuild.

### ðŸ§ª **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing**
   - Test all chat functionality (creation, messages, history).
   - Test invocation of various STDIO and SSE MCP tools.
   - **Test enhanced MCP server dashboard functionality**: Add/edit/delete servers, form validation, save operations.
   - **Test Logging System**: Verify log generation for all sources, log viewer functionality, export, health checks, PII masking.

### âœ¨ **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Continue refining UI based on testing.
   - Consider additional MCP server management features (bulk operations, templates, grouping).
   - Refine Log Viewer UI/UX based on usage.

### ðŸ“„ **Documentation and Code Cleanup**
   - Ensure all `cline_docs` are current (This task is now complete).
   - Review and finalize `docs/logging-system.md`.
   - Review and refactor any complex code sections from recent Bivvy climbs.

## Progress Status:
- **Comprehensive Logging System (x7K2)**: ðŸŸ¢ **Green (COMPLETED)** âœ…
- **MCP Server Dashboard Enhancement (p7X2)**: ðŸŸ¢ **Green (COMPLETED)** âœ… 
- **CSRF Token Handling**: ðŸŸ¢ **Green (Fixed by removal)**
- **Server-Side Fetch Calls**: ðŸŸ¢ **Green (Fixed with server-fetch utility)**
- **Development Environment Stability**: ðŸŸ¢ Green
- **Database Synchronization**: ðŸŸ¢ Green
- **Overall Application Functionality**: ðŸŸ¢ Green (Core functionality + enhanced MCP management + comprehensive logging)
