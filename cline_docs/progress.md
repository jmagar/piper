# Progress: Piper Development Status

**Last Updated**: Current Session (Server Action naming conventions fixed, React Context boundaries resolved)

**Overall Status**: 
- Development environment (`dev.sh`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, Prisma DB sync) is stable.
- CSRF token issue and server-side fetch URL parsing errors have been resolved.
- **Major enhancement completed: MCP Server Dashboard now includes full management capabilities.**
- **✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS: Comprehensive Logging System implemented AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL with verified file logging.**
- **✅ NEW SUCCESS: Server Action naming conventions and React Context boundaries resolved - Zero linter errors.**

## What Works / Recently Confirmed:

### ✅ **Development Environment & Database**
   - Docker Setup, Database Synchronization, Environment Variables, Core Infrastructure: All stable.

### ✅ **Server-Side Fetch Calls**
   - `lib/server-fetch.ts` utility operational for absolute URL API calls.
   - CSRF protection appropriately removed.

### ✅ **Chat Creation**
   - Chat creation flow and API route calls are functional.

### ✅ **MCP Server Management (Bivvy Climb p7X2 - COMPLETED)**
   - Enhanced Dashboard Dialog: Full CRUD in `app/components/mcp-servers/mcp-servers-dashboard.tsx`.
   - Unified interface, responsive design, robust error handling.

### ✅ **Comprehensive Logging System (Bivvy Climb x7K2 - COMPLETED & VERIFIED FUNCTIONAL)**
   - **Architecture**: Winston-based, structured JSON, static file logging with size-based rotation, correlation IDs.
   - **Core Components**: `lib/logger/index.ts` (main service), `lib/logger/types.ts`, `lib/logger/correlation.ts`, `lib/logger/error-handler.ts`, `lib/logger/mcp-logger.ts`, `lib/logger/ai-sdk-logger.ts`, `lib/logger/security.ts`, `lib/logger/rotation-config.ts`.
   - **Middleware**: `middleware/correlation.ts`, `middleware/logging.ts`, `middleware/error-handler.ts`, integrated into `middleware.ts`.
   - **Specialized Loggers**: For MCP (JSON-RPC, lifecycle, tool performance) and AI SDK (operations, streaming, costs).
   - **Error Handling**: Advanced classification, `AppError` class, global handlers.
   - **Security**: PII detection/masking, access controls (stubs), audit logging.
   - **Log Viewer**: `app/components/log-viewer/index.tsx` with filtering, search, real-time updates.
   - **APIs**: `/api/logs/route.ts` (querying), `/api/logs/export/route.ts` (export), `/api/logs/health/route.ts` (health check) ⭐ **VERIFIED WORKING**.
   - **Admin Integration**: Log viewer in `app/dashboard/manager.tsx`.
   - **Testing & Docs**: Foundational tests and `docs/logging-system.md` created.
   - **🔥 CRITICAL DEBUGGING COMPLETED**: 
     - Fixed conflicting `lib/logger.ts` file that prevented proper imports
     - Restored complex Winston logging (removed temporary console logging)
     - Implemented source-specific loggers with proper file separation
     - Changed to static filenames (`app.log`, `ai-sdk.log`, `mcp.log`, `http.log`, `error.log`)
     - Verified file logging is working with proper source filtering
     - Fixed all TypeScript/ESLint errors and import/export issues

### ✅ **Server Action Naming Conventions & React Context Boundaries (COMPLETED)**
   - **🎯 Problem**: 16 linter errors due to Next.js Server Action naming violations + `createContext` runtime errors
   - **🔧 Solution**: Systematic renaming of function props + Server/Client Component boundary fixes
   - **✅ Server Action Naming Fixes**:
     - DialogAgent: `onAgentClick` → `onAgentClickAction`, `onOpenChange` → `onOpenChangeAction`
     - DialogEditAgent: All function props renamed with "Action" suffix (`onAgentUpdated` → `onAgentUpdatedAction`, etc.)
     - Rules Components: All form handlers renamed (`handleInputChange` → `handleInputChangeAction`, etc.)
     - Prop type definitions and internal references updated across all components
   - **✅ React Context Boundary Resolution**:
     - Created `ClientLayoutWrapper` component as client boundary wrapper
     - Updated Server Components to use `ClientLayoutWrapper` instead of direct `LayoutApp` imports
     - Added `"use client"` to appropriate components (`rules/not-found.tsx`, `page.tsx`)
     - Preserved server-side benefits (SSR, SEO, database queries) where needed
   - **✅ Next.js App Router Modernization**:
     - Fixed async parameter handling in API routes (`await params` pattern)
     - Updated dynamic routes for proper Promise-based params
   - **✅ Critical Bug Fixes**:
     - Fixed agent deletion Prisma error by adding missing `id` prop
     - Resolved prop name mismatches and JSX syntax issues
   - **🏆 Result**: Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors, stable runtime, proper architecture

### ✅ **Previous Stable Items**
   - MCP Configuration Management, SSE MCP Tool Integration.

## What's Left to Build / Immediate Next Focus:

### 🧪 **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing**
   - Test all chat functionality (creation, messages, history).
   - Test invocation of various STDIO and SSE MCP tools.
   - **Test enhanced MCP server dashboard functionality**: Add/edit/delete servers, form validation, save operations.
   - **✅ Test Logging System**: Log generation for all sources verified, log viewer functionality confirmed, health checks working, source separation confirmed.
   - **✅ Test Server Action Naming & Context Boundaries**: Verified all components work correctly with new naming conventions.

### ✨ **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Continue refining UI based on testing.
   - Consider additional MCP server management features (bulk operations, templates, grouping).
   - Refine Log Viewer UI/UX based on usage.

### 🎯 **Rules System @mention Functionality (Next Major Feature)**
   - **Foundation Ready**: With clean component architecture and zero linter errors, ready to implement advanced Rules features
   - **Core Components**: Rules CRUD system already implemented and functional
   - **Next Steps**: Implement @mention detection, autocomplete, and prompt injection functionality
   - **Architecture**: Can now safely build complex features on stable foundation

### 📄 **Documentation and Code Cleanup**
   - ✅ Ensure all `cline_docs` are current (This task is now complete).
   - Review and finalize `docs/logging-system.md`.
   - Review and refactor any complex code sections from recent Bivvy climbs.
   - Document Server Action naming conventions and React Context patterns for future reference.
