# Piper Development Progress

**Last Updated**: Current Session (File Mention Integration)

## Overall Project Status: Active Development

---

### ✅ **Current Session: File Mention Integration - Phase 1 Complete**

- **Objective**: Implement interactive file selection for chat input mentions, allowing users to easily reference files from the Piper file system or upload new ones on-the-fly when composing a message.
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

- **Key Deliverables & Features Implemented**:
    1.  **`@files/` Mention Trigger**: Typing `@files/` in the chat input now activates a specialized workflow.
    2.  **`UnifiedSelectionModal` Enhancement**: 
        - When `@files/` is typed, this modal now presents two options: "Upload Files" and "Browse Files".
    3.  **"Upload Files" Flow**: 
        - Selecting this option triggers the system's native file selection dialog.
        - Uploaded files are processed by the existing file upload mechanism.
        - Implemented via a programmatically clicked hidden file input in `chat-input.tsx`.
    4.  **"Browse Files" Flow & `FileExplorerModal`**: 
        - Selecting this option closes `UnifiedSelectionModal` and opens the new `FileExplorerModal.tsx`.
        - `FileExplorerModal` embeds the `FileExplorer` component, allowing navigation of directories within Piper's file system (e.g., `./uploads`).
        - Users can select a file or folder within `FileExplorerModal`.
        - An "Attach Selected File" button (in `file-explorer.tsx`) becomes active upon selection.
        - Clicking "Attach Selected File" calls back to `chat-input.tsx` (via `useAgentCommand.ts`) to insert the selected path as a mention (e.g., `@files/path/to/item.txt`) into the chat input and closes the modal.
    5.  **Component Architecture**: 
        - **`FileExplorerModal.tsx`**: New modal created.
        - **`useAgentCommand.ts`**: Significantly updated to manage state for `FileExplorerModal` visibility (`isFileExplorerModalOpen`), handle selection callbacks (`handleFileMentionSelectedFromModal`), and correctly route logic for the `@files/` prefix.
        - **`chat-input.tsx`**: Modified to render `FileExplorerModal`, provide new handlers (`handleTriggerFileUpload`, `handleTriggerFileBrowse`) to `UnifiedSelectionModal`, and manage the hidden file input.
        - **`UnifiedSelectionModal.tsx`**: Adapted to display the "Upload"/"Browse" options for the `'files'` command type and call the new trigger handlers.
        - **`file-explorer.tsx`**: Enhanced with item selection state, UI highlighting, and the "Attach Selected File" button logic.
    6.  **Lint & Type Error Resolution**: All related TypeScript and ESLint errors encountered during this development cycle have been addressed.

- **Next Steps for File Mentions & Management**:
    - **Thorough Testing**: User validation of the implemented upload and browse-to-mention flows.
    - **Multi-Volume Support**: Extend `FileExplorer` and backend APIs for multiple mounted volumes.
    - **File Viewing**: Add preview capabilities within the file explorer.
    - **Advanced File Operations**: Implement file/folder deletion, creation, and moving.

### Milestone: TypeScript Error Resolution & Linter Fixes (Previous)
- **Objective**: Resolve a set of TypeScript type compatibility issues and linter errors primarily in `app/api/chat/route.ts` and related files.
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅
- **Details**: Addressed type mismatches between `AISDKToolCollection` and `ToolSet`, cleaned up unused imports and ESLint directives. Established a pattern for handling type incompatibilities with strategic casting.

### Milestone: Files Tab - Core Functionality (Previous)
- **Objective**: Implement the basic "Files" tab in Piper.
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅
- **Key Features**: 
    - `FileExplorer` component for listing files/directories from backend API.
    - Navigation via breadcrumbs.
    - `FileUploader` component integrated for uploading files with progress display and toast notifications.
    - Backend APIs for listing (`/api/files/list`) and uploading (`/api/files/upload`).
    - Path sanitization and file size checks.
    - Resolved `path-browserify` type issues.

### Future Milestones (Planned / In-Progress)

- **Advanced File Management Features**: (As listed in "Next Steps" for current session)
- **Agent Memory & Long-Term Context**: Enhancing agent's ability to recall information across sessions.
- **Web Browsing Capabilities**: Integrating tools for web searches and content extraction directly by agents.
- **Code Execution Environment**: Allowing agents to safely execute generated code.
- **Enhanced UI/UX for Tool Parameters**: More intuitive ways to input complex tool parameters.
- **User-Defined Agents & Tools**: Simplifying the process for users to create and manage their own agents and tools.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Continuous review and improvement of frontend and backend performance.
- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Expanding unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
