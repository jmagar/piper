# Progress

## What Works (Completed)

-   **Core Application Structure**: Next.js app with React components.
-   **Admin-Only Refactor - Phase 1 & 2 (Supabase Removal, Authentication Logic Removal & Simplification)**:
    -   Successfully removed all Supabase dependencies and code.
    -   Transitioned data persistence to a PostgreSQL database.
    -   Simplified user context to an admin-only model by removing internal authentication checks and user-specific logic from key components:
        -   `app/components/layout/header.tsx`: Chat history and controls always visible.
        -   `app/providers/user-preferences-provider.tsx`: Simplified for admin context.
        -   `app/components/chat/use-chat-utils.ts`: Refactored to remove auth dependencies and simplify signatures.
        -   `app/components/chat/chat.tsx`: Hardcoded `isAuthenticated` to `true`, removed `user` prop dependencies from hooks, updated hook calls.
        -   `app/components/chat/dialog-auth.tsx`: Effectively disabled.
        -   `app/components/agents/dialog-create-agent/dialog-trigger-create-agent.tsx`: Agent creation always available.
        -   `app/components/agents/agent-detail.tsx`: Agent deletion always available for admin.
        -   `app/components/chat/use-chat-handlers.ts`: Simplified for admin context.
    -   Cleaned up API endpoints and data access logic in relation to user context.
    -   Resolved numerous TypeScript and linting issues arising from these refactoring efforts.
-   **Prisma Integration for Chat Messages**: (Stable)
    -   Successfully resolved "PrismaClient is unable to run in this browser environment" errors.
    -   Correctly configured `"server-only"` for Prisma client and related server-side modules.
    -   Refactored client-side data fetching (`MessagesProvider`) to use a dedicated API route (`/app/api/messages/[chatId]/route.ts`) for accessing Prisma-backed data.
    -   Chat messages are now persisted and retrieved using Prisma with PostgreSQL.
-   **Initial Turbopack Runtime Error Resolution**: (Contextual)
    -   Fixed `localStorage` access issues in `useChatDraft` hook.
    -   Resolved Next.js "Invalid page configuration" warnings by renaming tool configuration files.
-   **Development Server Stability (with Webpack)**: `npm run dev` (using Webpack) starts correctly, and the application is accessible.
-   **Basic Chat Functionality**: Core chat interface and AI SDK integration are in place and functional with Prisma backend.
-   **Dockerization**: (Stable)
    -   Application and PostgreSQL database run in Docker containers managed by `docker-compose.yml`.
    -   Environment variables are correctly passed to the application container.
    -   `container_name` and `restart: unless-stopped` policies added.
-   **Prisma Integration & Database Setup**: (Stable)
    -   Prisma is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    -   Prisma migrations are automatically applied on application startup within the Docker container.
    -   Implemented `prisma.chat.upsert` in `/api/chat` route to ensure `Chat` records are created before `Message` records, addressing potential foreign key constraint violations.

## What's Left to Build / In Progress

-   **Testing Admin-Only Refactor**: Thoroughly test all components and functionalities affected by the removal of authentication to ensure stability and correctness.
-   **Final Codebase Review for Auth Remnants**: Ensure no legacy authentication logic remains.
-   **Address `userId` in `checkLimitsAndNotify`**: Determine appropriate identifier for rate limiting.
-   **Implement Local File Uploads**: (Next major feature post-refactor stabilization)
    *   Refactor upload logic for local filesystem.
    *   Remove cloud storage restrictions.
    *   Add comprehensive logging.
-   **Database Layer Refactor (Prisma with Postgres) - Finalization**: (Ongoing)
    *   Review and complete any remaining Prisma schema updates (e.g. ensuring all tables/fields align with admin-only model).
    *   Refactor any other data access logic beyond chat messages to use Prisma if necessary.
    *   Thoroughly test all CRUD operations for all models.
-   **Logging Implementation**.
-   **Deployment & Configuration Verification**.
-   **Final Testing**.

## Known Issues / Challenges

-   **Turbopack Instability**: After resolving Prisma client-side bundling issues, switching to `next dev --turbopack` results in a generic "An unexpected Turbopack error occurred" (HTTP 500). The project is currently using Webpack for stability.
-   **CSS Lint Errors**: Persistent, minor CSS lint errors in `app/globals.css` (e.g., `@plugin`, `@custom-variant`) unrelated to core application logic.

## Progress Status

-   **Section 3: Implement Local File Uploads** - (Pending completion of Section 2)
-   **Section 4: Database Layer Refactor (Prisma with Postgres)** - (Partially complete, ongoing)
-   **Section 5: Authentication (External via Authelia)** - Configuration/Setup (External, app assumes admin context)
-   **Section 6: Logging Implementation** - 
-   **Section 7: Deployment & Config** - (Docker setup stable, full verification pending)
-   **Section 8: Final Testing** -
