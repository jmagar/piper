# Product Context: Piper - Production-Ready AI Chat with Advanced MCP Tool Integration

## Why this project exists
Piper is a production-ready AI-powered chat application that provides intelligent access to external tools and services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The core innovation is its ability to seamlessly integrate with 19+ different MCP servers, providing the AI with access to real-world systems including web search, file operations, Docker management, media servers, and more.

## What problems it solves

### **Real-World Integration**
- **Tool Orchestration**: Enables complex workflows by giving AI access to 128+ tools across multiple domains (search, file systems, Docker, media, notifications, etc.)
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced chunked response processing transforms large tool outputs (64k+ characters) into structured, digestible formats for faster AI processing
- **Production Deployment**: Robust Docker-based deployment on Unraid with proper networking, persistence, and monitoring

### **Technical Challenges Solved**
- **MCP Protocol Implementation**: Complete MCP 2024-11-05 protocol compliance with proper initialization handshake
- **Mixed Environment Support**: Seamless integration of Python (uvx), Node.js (npm), and HTTP-based MCP servers
- **Large Content Processing**: Smart content extraction and chunking for web pages, search results, and other large responses
- **Docker Networking**: Proper container-to-host communication on Unraid systems

## How it should work

### **User Experience Flow**
1. **Natural Conversation**: User interacts through a modern, streaming chat interface
2. **Intelligent Tool Selection**: AI autonomously determines when external tools are needed
3. **Rapid Execution**: Tools execute quickly with results processed in seconds, not minutes
4. **Structured Responses**: Large tool outputs are intelligently summarized and structured for clarity

### **Technical Architecture Flow**

#### **Tool Definition and Discovery**
- `mcpManager.ts` discovers 19+ MCP servers from `config.json` and initializes `MCPService` instances
- Each server's tools are fetched, validated, and prepared for the AI SDK with proper schema wrapping
- **Chunked Response Processing**: Large tool responses (>5k characters) are automatically processed into structured sections

#### **Tool Execution Pipeline**
1. **AI Decision**: Vercel AI SDK identifies tool need and generates tool call
2. **Execution Bridge**: Tool's `execute` method routes to appropriate `MCPService` instance
3. **MCP Communication**: `MCPService.invokeTool()` implements complete MCP protocol with proper `initialized` notification
4. **Smart Processing**: `processLargeToolResponse()` transforms raw output into structured, digestible chunks
5. **Result Integration**: Processed results flow back to AI for rapid response generation

#### **Advanced Performance Features**
- **Intelligent Chunking**: HTML content → Title + Summary + Key Sections + Content Parts
- **Search Optimization**: JSON search results → Structured result summaries with importance ranking
- **Token Management**: 8096 token limit for balanced performance and quality
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response delivery with proper error handling

### **Production Capabilities**
- **19 Active MCP Servers**: Unraid system management, Docker operations, media control, web search, file operations
- **128+ Available Tools**: Comprehensive coverage of system administration and content retrieval
- **Docker Deployment**: Production-ready containerization with proper networking and persistence
- **Redis Caching**: MCP server status caching for responsive dashboard and monitoring
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and detailed logging throughout the system

## Success Metrics
- ✅ **Tool Execution Speed**: <5 seconds for most operations (previously 90+ seconds)
- ✅ **Response Quality**: Structured, relevant information extracted from large datasets
- ✅ **System Reliability**: All 19 MCP servers operational with 99%+ uptime
- ✅ **User Experience**: Natural conversation flow with intelligent tool integration
