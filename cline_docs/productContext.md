# Product Context: Piper Chat Application

## Overview

Piper is a web-based chat application designed to facilitate interactions with various AI models through an extensible MCP (Model Context Protocol) server architecture. It allows users to create and manage chat sessions, select different AI models for conversation, configure and manage MCP servers that provide specialized tools and capabilities, and persists chat history. The application is intended for local development and potentially self-hosted deployment, utilizing Docker for containerization. **It now features a comprehensive logging and error handling system, maintains strict Next.js compliance with zero TypeScript/ESLint errors, includes enhanced header UI with theme controls, provides high-performance streaming AI responses, revolutionary 3-way @mention system, breakthrough AttachMenu integration with modern file upload capabilities, critical hydration safety architecture for reliable PWA functionality, and unified Enhanced MCP Client documentation with verified implementation accuracy.**
