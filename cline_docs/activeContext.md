# Active Context: Piper Chat Application - Enhanced MCP Client Documentation Consolidation Complete

**Last Updated**: Current Session (Enhanced MCP Client Documentation Investigation & Consolidation Completed)

**Overall Goal**: Successfully consolidated three overlapping Enhanced MCP Client documentation files into one accurate, comprehensive source of truth by conducting a meticulous investigation of the actual implementation versus documented features.

## Critical Documentation Issues Resolved This Session

### Problem Summary:
**Documentation Fragmentation & Inaccuracy**: User identified that there were 3 different documentation files for the Enhanced MCP Client with overlapping but inconsistent information:
1. `docs/enhanced-mcp-client.md` (484 lines) - Comprehensive feature documentation
2. `docs/enhanced-mcp-integration-summary.md` (220 lines) - Integration status summary  
3. `docs/MCP_ENHANCED_CLIENT.md` (670 lines) - Detailed implementation guide

## Successfully Completed Documentation Investigation & Consolidation:

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Implementation Investigation** ‚úÖ
- **Thorough Codebase Analysis**: 
  - Examined `lib/mcp/enhanced-mcp-client.ts` (main implementation)
  - Analyzed `lib/mcp/client.ts` (MCPService using enhanced client)
  - Reviewed `lib/mcp/mcpManager.ts` (server management and tool aggregation)
  - Investigated `lib/mcp/enhanced-integration.ts` (metrics and health integration)
  - Checked `app/api/mcp-metrics/route.ts` (enhanced metrics endpoint)
  - Examined `prisma/schema.prisma` (database schema for metrics)
- **Findings**: Significant discrepancies between documented features and actual implementation

### ‚úÖ **Feature Discrepancy Analysis Using MECE Approach**
