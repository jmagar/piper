# Active Context: Piper Chat Application - @mention Rules System Implementation

**Last Updated**: Current Session (@mention Rules System Completed - Bivvy Climb p8z4)

**Overall Goal**: Successfully implemented a complete 3-way @mention system allowing users to @mention agents, tools, AND database rules directly in chat input for enhanced AI conversations.

## Completed Projects: @mention Rules System (Bivvy Climb p8z4)

### Project Summary:
**Major Feature Implementation**: Complete 3-way @mention functionality that extends the existing @mention system to include database-stored rules alongside agents and tools.

### Problems Solved:
1. **Limited @mention Functionality**: Users could only @mention agents and tools, but had no way to inject rule context directly into conversations.
2. **Manual Rule Application**: Users had to manually reference rules instead of seamlessly integrating them into AI conversations.
3. **Context Injection Gap**: No mechanism for users to dynamically enhance AI system prompts with rule-specific guidance.

## Successfully Completed Tasks:

### ✅ **Complete @mention Rules System (Bivvy Climb p8z4 - 10 Moves COMPLETED)**

#### **Move 1: Rules API Endpoint** ✅
- **Component Created**: `app/api/rules-available/route.ts`

  - Intelligent detection determines which dropdown to show based on search terms
  - Lowered trigger threshold to 5 for better responsiveness
  - Added rule fetching, filtering, and selection state management
- **Logic**: Uses fuzzy scoring + direct string matching for optimal user experience

#### **Move 3: Rule Dropdown Component** ✅

- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized touch targets and responsive layout

### **Perfect @mention Integration:**
- **Same Flow**: Click → "@" added to input → fuzzy search triggered → modal appears
- **Same Components**: Uses exact same `AgentCommand`, `ToolCommand`, `RuleCommand` components
- **Same Data**: Uses same `filteredAgents`, `filteredTools`, `filteredRules` arrays
- **Same Handlers**: Uses same selection handlers as @mention system
- **Same Search**: Users type to filter, exact same fuzzy matching algorithm
- **Seamless UX**: Indistinguishable from manually typing "@"
- **No Duplication**: Zero duplicate code or behavior

### **Mobile-Friendly Optimizations:**
- **Responsive Modal Positioning**: `inset-x-4` on mobile, centered on desktop
- **Touch-Friendly Targets**: 44px minimum touch targets for all buttons and menu items
- **Optimized Layout**: Responsive dropdown width (`w-48` on mobile, `w-52` on desktop)
- **Touch Backdrop**: Proper touch handling for modal backdrop dismissal
- **Mobile-First Padding**: `min-h-[48px] py-3 px-3` for all menu items
- **Flexible Icons**: `flex-shrink-0` prevents icon distortion on small screens
