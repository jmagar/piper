# Active Context: Piper Chat Application - Comprehensive Logging System Implementation

**Last Updated**: Current Session (Reflecting logging system Bivvy climb completion)

**Overall Goal**: Successfully implemented a comprehensive, production-ready logging and error handling system throughout the Piper application.

## Completed Project: Comprehensive Logging System (Bivvy Climb x7K2)

### Project Summary:
Designed and implemented an app-wide logging architecture using Winston. This system includes structured JSON logging, correlation ID tracking, specialized loggers for MCP and AI SDK operations, security features (PII detection, sanitization), a web-based log viewer for administrators, and automated log rotation and health checks.

### Problem Solved:
Prior to this implementation, the application lacked a centralized or detailed logging mechanism, making debugging, error tracking, and operational monitoring difficult. The new system provides deep visibility into all aspects of the application, significantly improving observability and maintainability.

## Successfully Completed Features & Bivvy Moves (x7K2 - 25 Moves):

### âœ… **Core Logging Infrastructure**
- **Dependencies**: Winston, winston-daily-rotate-file, uuid installed. (Move 1)
- **Directory Structure**: `/logs` with `archived/` subdirectory created. (Move 2)
- **Core Logger Service (`lib/logger/index.ts`)**: Winston configured with multiple transports, structured JSON logging, source-specific loggers (MCP, AI SDK, HTTP), correlation ID support, and health checks. (Move 3)
- **Type Definitions (`lib/logger/types.ts`)**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all logging aspects. (Move 4)
- **Log Rotation Configuration (`lib/logger/rotation-config.ts`)**: Automated log rotation and retention policies with environment-specific settings. (Move 23)

### âœ… **Correlation & Context Management**
- **Correlation ID Management (`lib/logger/correlation.ts`)**: AsyncLocalStorage for context tracking. (Move 5)
- **Correlation Middleware (`middleware/correlation.ts`)**: Injects correlation IDs into requests (Next.js & Express support). (Move 6)

### âœ… **Request & Error Handling Middleware**
- **Request/Response Logging (`middleware/logging.ts`)**: Logs HTTP requests/responses with security features and timing. (Move 7)
- **Global Error Handling (`middleware/error-handler.ts`)**: Catches unhandled errors, uses custom `AppError`. (Move 8)
- **Error Classification (`lib/logger/error-handler.ts`)**: Advanced pattern matching for error categorization and retry logic. (Move 9)

### âœ… **Specialized Loggers**
- **MCP Logger (`lib/logger/mcp-logger.ts`)**: Handles JSON-RPC messages, server lifecycle, and tool execution performance. (Move 10)
- **AI SDK Logger (`lib/logger/ai-sdk-logger.ts`)**: Tracks AI operations, streaming, costs, and token usage. (Move 11)

### âœ… **Integration & Wrapping**
- **Next.js Middleware Update (`middleware.ts`)**: Integrated all logging, correlation, and error handling middleware. (Move 12)
- **MCP Server Implementation Wrapping**: Added logging to MCP server operations and tool executions in `lib/mcp/client.ts`. (Move 13)
- **AI SDK Operation Wrapping**: Added logging to AI SDK operations in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. (Move 14)
- **API Route Error Handling**: Ensured consistent error handling and logging in API routes. (Move 15)

### âœ… **Log Viewer & Admin Interface**
- **Log Viewer Component (`app/components/log-viewer/index.tsx`)**: Comprehensive UI with filtering, search, real-time updates, and detailed log inspection. (Moves 16, 17, 18, 19)
- **Log Viewer API (`app/api/logs/route.ts`, `app/api/logs/export/route.ts`)**: Endpoints for querying, fetching, and exporting logs. (Created during log viewer implementation)
- **Admin Interface Integration (`app/dashboard/manager.tsx`)**: Log viewer added as a tab in the system administration dashboard. (Move 20)

### âœ… **Security & Monitoring**
- **Log Health Check Endpoint (`app/api/logs/health/route.ts`)**: Monitors log system health, disk space, and logger status. (Move 21)
- **Security Measures (`lib/logger/security.ts`)**: PII detection, data sanitization, access controls, and audit logging. (Move 22)

### âœ… **Testing & Documentation**
- **Testing**: Foundational test structure for logging components implemented (basic patterns). (Move 24)
- **Documentation (`docs/logging-system.md`)**: Comprehensive documentation covering setup, usage, configuration, and troubleshooting. (Move 25)

## Current Status:
**ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETE: Comprehensive Logging System** - The application now has a robust, centralized logging system with advanced features for error handling, monitoring, and security. All 25 moves of Bivvy climb x7K2 are complete.

## Next Focus Areas:
- Ongoing monitoring of the new logging system's performance and effectiveness.
- Addressing any new bugs or issues that arise from user testing or system operation.
- Continuing with other application enhancements as prioritized.
