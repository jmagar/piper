# Active Context: Piper Chat Application - MCP Server Dashboard Enhancement

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27 (Current Session)

**Overall Goal**: Successfully completed the enhancement of the MCP Servers Dashboard Dialog by merging all management functionality from the standalone manager.tsx component into the existing read-only dashboard.

## Completed Project: MCP Server Dashboard Enhancement (Bivvy Climb p7X2)

### Project Summary:
Transformed the read-only MCP Servers Dashboard dialog into a fully functional management interface by integrating comprehensive CRUD capabilities from `app/dashboard/manager.tsx` into `app/components/mcp-servers/mcp-servers-dashboard.tsx`.

### Problem Solved:
Previously, users had two separate interfaces for MCP server management:
- A read-only dashboard dialog for health checks and tool listings (accessed via header Server icon)
- A separate standalone manager page for configuration (manager.tsx)

This created confusion and poor UX. Now there's a single unified interface.

## Successfully Completed Features:

### âœ… **Full CRUD Operations**
- **Add New Server**: Complete modal form with validation for all transport types (stdio, sse, http)
- **Edit Server**: Pre-populated modal forms for updating existing server configurations
- **Delete Server**: Confirmation dialogs for safe removal of servers
- **Toggle Enable/Disable**: Switch controls for each server card

### âœ… **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Header Controls**: "Add New Server" and "Save Configuration" buttons with dirty state detection
- **Server Cards**: Enhanced with action buttons (edit/delete) while preserving hover functionality
- **Status Indicators**: Maintained existing health check and tool listing capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all screen sizes

### âœ… **Technical Implementation**
- **Dual API Integration**: Combined `/api/mcp-servers` (status) and `/api/mcp-config` (CRUD) endpoints
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state handling with dirty tracking and optimistic updates
- **Form Validation**: Robust client-side validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and user feedback via toast notifications

### âœ… **All 10 Bivvy Moves Completed**
1. âœ… Setup enhanced dashboard component structure and imports
2. âœ… Add CRUD state management and dual API integration  
3. âœ… Add header controls and action buttons
4. âœ… Create add server modal with full form
5. âœ… Add edit server functionality
6. âœ… Implement delete server with confirmation
7. âœ… Implement save configuration functionality
8. âœ… Enhance server cards with action controls
9. âœ… Add form validation and error handling
10. âœ… Final testing and responsive design verification

## Key Files Modified:
- **`app/components/mcp-servers/mcp-servers-dashboard.tsx`**: Main enhancement - transformed from read-only to full management interface
- **`.bivvy/p7X2-climb.md`**: Comprehensive PRD documenting the feature requirements
- **`.bivvy/p7X2-moves.json`**: Task breakdown and completion tracking

## Current Status:
**ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETE** - The MCP Servers Dashboard Dialog now provides a complete management experience within the existing dialog structure. Users can view server status AND manage configurations from a single, intuitive interface.

## Next Focus Areas:
- Monitor user experience with the enhanced dashboard
- Consider additional MCP server management features (bulk operations, templates, etc.)
- Continue with other application enhancements as needed
