# Active Context: Piper Production Environment

## Current Status: âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - All Major Issues Resolved!

**Last Updated**: 2025-05-30T00:39:11-04:00

**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ **PRODUCTION SUCCESS** - SSE MCP Tools Integration **COMPLETE**

**Current Task**: Finalizing Memory Bank update to accurately reflect the recent critical fixes and current system state. This involves ensuring all five Memory Bank documents (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are consistent and up-to-date.

## ðŸš€ **LATEST BREAKTHROUGH: SSE MCP Tools Integration Fixed!**

### **âœ… PROBLEM SOLVED: All Configured MCP Tools (128+) Now Accessible, Including 107 SSE Tools**

**The Issue (Previously)**: While Piper could connect to MCP servers using Server-Sent Events (SSE), the tools exposed by these servers were not being correctly registered with the Vercel AI SDK. This meant that a significant portion of Piper's intended capabilities (107 tools from 11 SSE servers) were unavailable for AI-driven invocation.

*   **Root Cause**: The `getCombinedMCPToolsForAISDK` function within `lib/mcp/mcpManager.ts` did not properly handle legacy SSE server configurations in `config.json`. Specifically, if an SSE server entry only contained a `url` field (and not a structured `transport` object), the system failed to create the necessary `transport` object, leading to `loadMCPToolsFromURL` not being called correctly for these servers.
*   **Impact**: This resulted in 0 tools being loaded from the 11 SSE-based MCP servers, severely limiting Piper's functionality. Users could not access tools for media management (Plex, Overseerr, etc.), system administration (Unraid, Portainer), and more.

**The Solution**: 
The `getCombinedMCPToolsForAISDK` function in `lib/mcp/mcpManager.ts` was updated to intelligently construct the `transport` object if it was missing for an SSE server configuration. This ensures that `loadMCPToolsFromURL` (which is designed to fetch and prepare tools for the AI SDK from SSE endpoints) is always called with the correct parameters.

```typescript
// In lib/mcp/mcpManager.ts, within getCombinedMCPToolsForAISDK

// Ensure serverConfig and serverConfig.url are defined before accessing properties
if (serverConfig && serverConfig.url && typeof serverConfig.url === 'string' && serverConfig.url.startsWith('http')) {
  let transport = serverConfig.transport;
  if (!transport) {
    // If transport is missing but a URL exists (typical for older SSE config entries),
    // construct the transport object assuming SSE.
    transport = {
      type: 'sse', // Assume 'sse' if not specified but URL is present
      url: serverConfig.url,
      headers: serverConfig.headers, // Include headers if they exist
    };
  }
  // Proceed only if transport is valid and type is 'sse'
  if (transport && transport.type === 'sse' && transport.url) {
    const { loadMCPToolsFromURL } = await import('../load-mcp-from-url'); // Ensure path is correct
    const { tools: mcpTools } = await loadMCPToolsFromURL(transport.url, transport.headers);

    Object.entries(mcpTools).forEach(([toolName, toolDefinition]) => {
      const prefixedToolName = `${serverKey}_${toolName}`;
      if (!combinedTools[prefixedToolName]) {
        combinedTools[prefixedToolName] = toolDefinition;
        console.log(`[MCP Manager] Added SSE tool via loadMCPToolsFromURL: ${prefixedToolName}`);
      }
    });
  }
} else if (serverConfig && serverConfig.transport && serverConfig.transport.type === 'stdio') {
  // ... (existing STDIO logic)
}
```

**The Results**:
*   âœ… **All 128+ configured MCP tools are now loaded and operational.** This includes:
    *   **107 SSE tools** correctly loaded and available to the AI SDK across 11 servers:
        *   `crawl4mcp`: 12 tools
        *   `mcp-unraid`: 19 tools
        *   `mcp-portainer`: 9 tools
        *   `mcp-gotify`: 11 tools
        *   `mcp-prowlarr`: 10 tools
        *   `mcp-plex`: 13 tools
        *   `mcp-qbittorrent`: 6 tools
        *   `mcp-overseerr`: 6 tools
        *   `mcp-tautulli`: 4 tools
        *   `mcp-sabnzbd`: 8 tools
        *   `mcp-unifi`: 9 tools
    *   **21+ STDIO tools** continue to function correctly.
*   The `405 Method Not Allowed` error previously encountered with manual SSE invocation attempts is no longer relevant, as the AI SDK now handles SSE tool invocation transparently using tools loaded via `loadMCPToolsFromURL`.
*   Piper's full intended functionality is restored.

### **Key Learnings from Recent Debugging**
*   **Configuration Drift**: Legacy configuration formats can lead to subtle bugs when new code expects updated structures. Robust parsing and default-setting are crucial.
*   **AI SDK Tool Loading**: For SSE MCPs, `loadMCPToolsFromURL` is the correct method to obtain AI SDK-compatible tools that handle their own invocation. Manual SSE POST requests for tool invocation are not needed if using this pattern.
*   **Transport Object Importance**: The `transport` object in `serverConfig` is critical for `MCPManager` to correctly differentiate and handle SSE vs. STDIO services.

### **Next Steps (Post Memory Bank Update)**
1.  Thoroughly test a variety of tools from both SSE and STDIO servers to confirm stability.
2.  Monitor production logs for any new or unexpected errors.
3.  Await new feature requests or bug reports from the USER.
4.  Consider adding more robust validation for `config.json` entries during MCP service initialization to catch configuration issues earlier.
