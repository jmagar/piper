# Active Context: Piper Chat Application - TypeScript Error Resolution & Linter Fixes ✅

**Last Updated**: Current Session (File Mention & Explorer Integration)

**STATUS**: **ALL LINTER ERRORS RESOLVED** ✅

## ✅ **CURRENT SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS: TypeScript Error Resolution & Linter Fixes**

### **Complete Linter Error Resolution** ✅:
**Context**: Four specific linter errors reported by user in chat API and MCP client files
- **TypeScript Type Compatibility Issue**: Resolved incompatibility between `AISDKToolCollection` and `ToolSet` types in `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Multiple tool sources (MCP tools, agent tools, AI SDK tools) have different type signatures that don't align with AI SDK's strict `ToolSet` expectations
- **Strategic Solution**: 
  - Properly typed `toolsToUse` variable as `ToolSet | undefined` from declaration
  - Used strategic double casting (`as unknown as ToolSet`) at integration boundaries
  - Applied casting at assignment points rather than usage points for better type safety
- **Pattern Established**: Handle runtime-compatible but TypeScript-incompatible union types with explicit variable typing + strategic casting
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` (tool selection logic), `lib/chat-store/chats/api.ts` (unused imports), `lib/mcp/enhanced-mcp-client.ts` (import cleanup)

### **Specific Error Resolution** ✅:
1. **✅ Fixed**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` line 502: "Unexpected any" TypeScript error
2. **✅ Fixed**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` line 500: Unused eslint-disable directive
3. **✅ Fixed**: `lib/chat-store/chats/api.ts` line 5: Unused import `fetchClient`
4. **✅ Fixed**: `lib/chat-store/chats/api.ts` line 6: Unused import `serverFetchJson`

### **Technical Implementation Details** ✅:
- **Type Safety Preservation**: Maintained runtime compatibility while satisfying TypeScript compiler
- **Clean Architecture**: Removed redundant type casting and unused ESLint directives

### **File Mention & Explorer Integration (Current Session)** ✅:
**Context**: Enhance chat input with the ability to mention files from the Piper file system, improving workflow for referencing project files, logs, or other relevant documents within the chat.

- **Core Functionality Achieved**:
    - Users can type `@files/` in the chat input to initiate file-related actions.
    - The `UnifiedSelectionModal` now intercepts the `@files/` command and presents two distinct options: "Upload Files" and "Browse Files".
    - **Upload Files Option**: Triggers the native system file dialog, allowing users to select and upload files directly. This leverages existing file upload infrastructure.
    - **Browse Files Option**: Opens a new, dedicated `FileExplorerModal` for navigating the existing file system within Piper.

- **New Components & Major Modifications**:
    - **`FileExplorerModal.tsx` (New)**:
        - A modal dialog component that embeds the `FileExplorer`.
        - Purpose: Allows users to visually navigate directories, view file/folder listings, and select an item to be inserted as a `@files/` mention in the chat.
        - Receives an `onFileSelectForMention` callback to pass the selected path back to the chat input logic.
    - **`useAgentCommand.ts` (Modified)**:
        - Introduced state variables (`isFileExplorerModalOpen`, `setIsFileExplorerModalOpen`) to manage the visibility of `FileExplorerModal`.
        - Added `handleFileMentionSelectedFromModal` callback to process the selection from `FileExplorerModal` and insert the mention.
        - Enhanced mention processing logic: when `@files/` is detected, it now sets `isFileExplorerModalOpen` to `false` (as `UnifiedSelectionModal` handles the initial choice) and relies on `chat-input.tsx` to open the correct modal based on user choice from `UnifiedSelectionModal`.
        - Restored `setPendingTool`, `setSelectedTool`, and `setSelectedAgent` to its return object to fix downstream lint errors in `chat-input.tsx`.
    - **`chat-input.tsx` (Modified)**:
        - Integrated `FileExplorerModal`, rendering it conditionally based on `isFileExplorerModalOpen`.
        - Implemented `handleTriggerFileUpload`: Uses a `useRef` to a hidden `<input type="file">` element, programmatically clicking it to open the system file dialog. The hidden input's `onChange` calls the existing `handleFileUpload`.
        - Implemented `handleTriggerFileBrowse`: Calls `agentCommand.setIsFileExplorerModalOpen(true)` and `agentCommand.closeSelectionModal()` (to close `UnifiedSelectionModal`).
        - Passed `onTriggerFileUpload` and `handleTriggerFileBrowse` as props to `UnifiedSelectionModal`.
        - Wrapped `agentCommand.handleUrlSubmit` when passing it as `onUrlSubmit` to `UnifiedSelectionModal` to align function signatures (resolving a type error).
        - Corrected the definition order of `handleFileUpload` and `handleHiddenInputChange` to resolve a "used before declaration" lint error.
    - **`UnifiedSelectionModal.tsx` (Modified)**:
        - Updated `activeCommandType` prop to include `'files'`.
        - When `activeCommandType` is `'files'`, it now renders "Upload Files" and "Browse Files" list items instead of a searchable list.
        - Accepts and utilizes new props `onTriggerFileUpload` and `onTriggerFileBrowse` for these options.
        - The condition for rendering the search input was adjusted to exclude the `'files'` type.
    - **`file-explorer.tsx` (Previously enhanced in this overall feature development)**:
        - Features selection state (`selectedItemPath`) with UI highlighting for the selected file/folder.
        - Includes an "Attach Selected File" button, which becomes active when an item is selected and `onFileSelectForMention` prop is provided. This button triggers the callback with the `selectedItemPath`.

- **Lint & Type Error Resolution**:
    - Addressed TypeScript errors related to hook return object signatures in `useAgentCommand.ts` and their consumption in `chat-input.tsx`.
    - Resolved type incompatibilities for `activeCommandType` and `onUrlSubmit` props passed to `UnifiedSelectionModal`.
    - Fixed "used before declaration" error for `handleFileUpload` in `chat-input.tsx`.

- **Outcome**: A more integrated and user-friendly way to reference files in chat, supporting both new uploads and selection from existing files. The system now correctly distinguishes between the initial mention type selection and the subsequent file browsing/upload action.
