# Task: Consolidate MCP Client Logic - COMPLETE

**Status: This task has been successfully completed.**

## Summary

The primary goal of this task was to consolidate all Model Context Protocol (MCP) client functionalities into a single, enhanced, and modular structure under `lib/mcp/enhanced/`. The redundant `lib/mcp/client.ts` and the monolithic `lib/mcp/enhanced-mcp-client.ts` have been removed, simplifying the MCP architecture, eliminating code duplication, and providing a single source of truth for all MCP client operations.

## Final Architecture

All MCP client logic is now located in the `lib/mcp/enhanced/` directory, which contains a set of focused, well-documented, and easily maintainable modules.

## Key Outcomes

- **Unified Client**: A single, modular client now handles all transport types (stdio, sse, etc.).
- **Code Consolidation**: Redundant code has been eliminated.
- **Improved Maintainability**: The new modular structure is easier to understand, test, and extend.
- **Dependencies Updated**: All parts of the application that previously used the old clients now use the new, unified client.

This task is now closed.
