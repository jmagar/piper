## Feature Overview

**Feature Name**: Piper Progressive Web App Implementation  
**Purpose**: Transform Piper into a PWA to provide app-like experiences across all platforms with offline functionality, installability, and enhanced performance  
**Problem Being Solved**: Users currently cannot install Piper as an app, lack offline functionality, and experience slower loading times on mobile devices  
**Success Metrics**: 
- Lighthouse PWA Score of 90+
- Successful installation capability across major browsers
- Functional offline mode for basic chat operations
- First Contentful Paint < 2 seconds

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Web App Manifest**: Dynamic manifest file defining app metadata, icons, and behavior
2. **Service Worker**: Comprehensive caching strategy with network-first API calls and cache-first static assets
3. **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB implementation for storing chats, messages, and user preferences offline
4. **Install Prompt**: User-friendly installation prompt with dismissal logic
5. **Offline Indicators**: Visual feedback when app is offline with limited functionality warnings
6. **App Shell Architecture**: Instant loading shell for consistent user experience

### Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: First Contentful Paint < 2s, Lighthouse PWA score 90+
- **Offline Capability**: Basic chat functionality available offline with sync when online
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with iOS Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Storage**: Efficient IndexedDB usage with automatic cleanup
- **Security**: Secure service worker implementation with proper scope management

### User Requirements
- **Installation**: One-click install from browser with proper app icons
- **Offline Usage**: Ability to view previous chats and compose messages offline
- **Seamless Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connection restored
- **Native Feel**: App-like navigation and interactions when installed
- **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions

## Design and Implementation

### User Flow
1. **First Visit**: User browses Piper normally, install prompt appears after engagement
2. **Installation**: User clicks install, app appears in device app drawer/dock
3. **Offline Usage**: App works offline for viewing chats and basic operations
4. **Sync**: When online, pending actions sync automatically in background

### Architecture Overview
- **App Shell Pattern**: Core UI cached for instant loading
- **Service Worker**: Handles caching, offline functionality, and background sync
- **IndexedDB**: Stores user data, chat history, and pending actions
- **Cache Strategy**: Network-first for API calls, cache-first for static assets

### API Specifications
- **Background Sync**: Queue offline actions for later transmission
- **Cache API**: Store responses with appropriate TTL strategies
- **IndexedDB API**: Structured storage for complex offline data

### Data Models
```typescript
interface OfflineChat {
  id: string
  messages: Message[]
  timestamp: number
  synced: boolean
}

interface PendingAction {
  id: string
  type: 'send_message' | 'create_chat' | 'update_settings'
  data: any
  timestamp: number
}
```

## Development Details

### Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation**: Manifest, icons, basic service worker
2. **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB implementation with chat storage
3. **Service Worker**: Comprehensive caching and sync strategies
4. **UI Components**: Install prompt, offline indicators, loading states
5. **Performance**: Optimization and app shell implementation
6. **Testing**: PWA audit, cross-platform testing, performance validation

### Caching Strategies
- **App Shell**: Cache First (HTML, CSS, JS bundles)
- **API Calls**: Network First with 10s timeout, fallback to cache
- **Static Assets**: Cache First with 1-year expiration
- **User Data**: IndexedDB with background sync

### Security Considerations
- Service worker scope limited to application domain
- Secure API token handling in offline storage
- Content Security Policy updates for service worker
- Regular cache cleanup to prevent storage abuse

## Testing Approach

### Test Cases
1. **Installation**: Verify install prompt and app installation across browsers
2. **Offline Functionality**: Test chat viewing and message composition offline
3. **Sync**: Verify background sync when connection restored
4. **Performance**: Lighthouse audits and Core Web Vitals
5. **Cross-Platform**: iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Desktop browsers

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PWA installable on all major browsers
- [ ] Offline chat viewing functionality works
- [ ] Background sync successfully transmits queued actions
- [ ] Lighthouse PWA score â‰¥ 90
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 2 seconds
- [ ] App shell loads instantly on repeat visits

### Edge Cases
- Network connectivity issues during sync
- Storage quota exceeded scenarios
- Service worker update and cache invalidation
- Multiple tab synchronization

## Design Assets

### Icon Requirements
- Comprehensive icon set: 72x72 to 512x512 pixels
- Maskable icons for adaptive icon support
- Favicon variations for browser compatibility
- Apple Touch Icons for iOS compatibility
- Shortcut icons for app shortcuts

### UI Guidelines
- Maintain existing Tailwind CSS design system
- Add offline state indicators
- Implement skeleton loading screens
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Plans
- Advanced background sync strategies
- Push notifications integration
- Enhanced offline AI model caching
- Progressive download of chat history

### Enhancement Ideas
- Voice messages offline recording
- File sharing with offline queue
- Advanced caching of AI model responses
- Collaborative editing with conflict resolution

### Known Limitations
- Limited AI functionality while offline
- Storage quota restrictions on mobile browsers
- iOS Safari installation limitations
- Background sync frequency restrictions

## Performance Targets

- **Lighthouse PWA Score**: 90+
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 2 seconds
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3 seconds
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80% for repeat visits
- **Offline Functionality**: 95% of read operations available offline
