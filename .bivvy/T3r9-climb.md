## Problem Statement

Users are consistently receiving "This model does not support file uploads. Please select another model." when attempting to use Anthropic models (Claude) via OpenRouter, despite these models having `vision: true` in their model configurations. OpenAI models work correctly for file uploads.

## Current Status Analysis

Based on recent investigation, there are defensive hacks in `button-file-upload.tsx` that attempt to force-enable file uploads for Claude models when lookup fails:

```typescript
// START HACK: Force enable for Claude 4 models if the lookup fails
if (!isFileUploadAvailable) {
  // Handle Claude 4 models that might have ID mismatches
  if (model.includes("claude-4") || model.includes("claude-3")) {
    console.warn(`ButtonFileUpload: Model lookup failed for ${model}. Assuming Claude model supports vision. Check MODELS array.`);
    isFileUploadAvailable = true;
  }
}
```

The existence of this hack suggests there's a fundamental issue with model ID resolution when Anthropic models are routed through OpenRouter.

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The file upload detection logic in `ButtonFileUpload` component uses:
```typescript
let isFileUploadAvailable = MODELS.find((m) => m.id === model)?.vision
```

**Suspected Issue**: When Anthropic models are accessed via OpenRouter, the actual model ID passed to the component may differ from the model IDs defined in the `MODELS` array, causing the lookup to fail and defaulting to "no vision support."

Potential model ID mismatches:
- **MODELS array**: `"anthropic/claude-4-sonnet-20250514"`
- **Actual runtime ID**: Could be different OpenRouter-specific format
- **Provider routing**: OpenRouter may transform model IDs during API calls

## Investigation Requirements

### 1. Model ID Tracking
- Add comprehensive logging to track exact model IDs at runtime
- Compare model IDs received by `ButtonFileUpload` vs. MODELS array definitions
- Identify any transformation occurring through OpenRouter routing

### 2. Provider Resolution Analysis
- Examine how OpenRouter models are resolved in `lib/openproviders/`
- Check if provider mapping affects model ID consistency
- Verify OpenRouter API model naming conventions

### 3. Vision Detection Logic
- Test current fallback mechanisms
- Verify all Anthropic models have correct `vision: true` settings
- Ensure model lookup logic handles OpenRouter routing correctly

## Success Criteria

1. **✅ Root Cause Identified**: Clear understanding of why Anthropic model lookups fail
2. **✅ Consistent Model IDs**: Anthropic models reliably found in MODELS array
3. **✅ File Upload Works**: All vision-enabled Anthropic models allow file uploads
4. **✅ No False Positives**: Non-vision models correctly blocked from file uploads
5. **✅ Clean Implementation**: Remove defensive hacks once proper fix is implemented

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Diagnostics
- Add debug logging to `ButtonFileUpload` component
- Implement model ID tracking throughout the provider chain
- Document actual vs. expected model IDs for Anthropic models

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis
- Trace model ID resolution from selection to file upload check
- Identify where OpenRouter routing may alter model IDs
- Compare working OpenAI model flow vs. failing Anthropic model flow

### Phase 3: Fix Implementation
- Implement proper model ID resolution for OpenRouter-routed models
- Update model lookup logic to handle provider routing consistently
- Remove temporary defensive hacks once proper fix is verified

## Testing Strategy

1. **Model Selection Testing**: Verify each Anthropic model properly resolves
2. **File Upload Testing**: Test drag-drop, click-browse, and paste functionality
3. **Provider Consistency**: Ensure fix works for all OpenRouter-routed models
4. **Regression Testing**: Verify OpenAI models continue working correctly
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with different model ID formats and routing scenarios

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on diagnostic logging first to understand exact failure points
- Avoid expanding defensive hacks - aim for proper systematic fix
- Ensure any changes maintain compatibility with direct Anthropic API usage
- Consider future-proofing for additional OpenRouter model providers

## Expected Outcome

After this investigation and fix:
- Users can successfully upload files when using any vision-enabled Anthropic model via OpenRouter
- Model ID resolution is consistent across all providers
- File upload detection logic is robust and properly handles provider routing
- No defensive hacks needed for model detection
