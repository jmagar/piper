# Move 2: Convert Menu Items to Black/White Theme

## Goal
Convert the colorful gradient menu items to a clean black/white monochrome theme as requested by the user.

## Current Problem
- Menu items were using colorful gradients (blue, orange, purple, green, pink)
- Complex layered styling with multiple background elements
- User specifically requested black/white theme instead

## Solution Strategy
1. **Replace colorful gradients** - Change from gradient backgrounds to solid black
2. **Simplify styling** - Remove complex layered background elements
3. **Maintain usability** - Keep hover states and visual feedback
4. **Use native buttons** - Replace Button components to avoid conflicts

## Implementation Details
- Changed `bg-gradient-to-r ${color}` to `bg-black`
- Added hover state with `hover:bg-gray-800`
- Simplified icon containers to use `bg-white/10`
- Replaced Button components with native button elements
- Removed unused color variables and imports

## Results
- Clean black background with white text
- Subtle gray hover states for feedback
- Professional monochrome appearance
- Maintained all functionality and animations
- Fixed linter errors from unused variables

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Menu items now display in clean black/white theme
