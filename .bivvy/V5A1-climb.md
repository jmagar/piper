    ## Feature Overview

    **Feature Name and ID**: AI SDK v5 Alpha Upgrade (V5A1)
    **Purpose Statement**: To migrate the Piper project from its current AI SDK (v3/v4 patterns) to the latest AI SDK v5 Alpha, enabling usage of new features, architectural improvements, and ensuring the project stays current with Vercel's AI tooling.
    **Problem Being Solved**: The current AI SDK version is becoming outdated. V5 offers significant improvements in message handling, agentic control, streaming, and tool usage that are beneficial for Piper's advanced functionalities. This upgrade is necessary to leverage these improvements and maintain compatibility.
    **Success Metrics**:
        - All existing chat functionalities (text generation, tool usage, MCP integration) are working correctly with AI SDK v5 Alpha.
        - Message history (new messages) is correctly stored and retrieved using the new `UIMessage` format.
        - Application is stable with the new SDK versions.
        - Performance is comparable or improved.
        - All 130+ MCP tools are correctly loaded and invokable via the new SDK patterns.

    ## Requirements

    **Functional Requirements**:
        - Preserve all existing core chat functionalities.
        - Implement the new dual message system (`UIMessage`, `ModelMessage`).
        - Adopt Server-Sent Events (SSE) for all streaming responses from `/api/chat`.
        - Refactor `useChat` hook usage to incorporate `ChatStore`.
        - Update tool definitions and execution logic to align with v5 patterns.
        - Ensure MCP client integration works as expected.

    **Technical Requirements**:
        - Successfully update all AI SDK dependencies to specified v5 Alpha versions.
        - Update Prisma schema and client-side data stores for the new message format.
        - Ensure no regressions in performance or stability.
        - All code interacting with the AI SDK must use v5 Alpha APIs and types.

    **User Requirements**: From an end-user perspective, the chat application should function as it did before, with potential under-the-hood improvements in streaming or data handling. Developers (users of the codebase) will need to adapt to new SDK patterns.

    **Constraints**:
        - This is an Alpha version; API instability is expected. Pin exact versions.
        - The decision on migrating existing message data (PostgreSQL & IndexedDB) needs to be finalized. The current plan in `v5.md` notes this was "skipped" based on earlier analysis.
        - Compatibility of `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` with v5 Alpha needs verification.

    ## Design and Implementation

    **User Flow**: Existing user flows for chat interaction should remain unchanged from an external perspective.
    **Architecture Overview**: The primary architectural change involves replacing AI SDK v3/v4 patterns with v5 Alpha patterns. This includes:
        - `UIMessage`/`ModelMessage` split.
        - `ChatStore` for client-state.
        - SSE for streaming.
        - Potentially new agentic loop patterns in `app/api/chat/route.ts`.
    **Dependent Components**: All components listed in `relevantFiles` that interact with the AI SDK.
    **API Specifications**: The `/api/chat` endpoint will change its request/response structure based on `UIMessage` and SSE. The `/api/messages/[chatId]` endpoint will serve `UIMessage[]`.
    **Data Models**: Significant change to the `Message` data model in Prisma and potentially IndexedDB.

    ## Development Details

    **Relevant Files**: See `<relevantFiles>` section.
    **Implementation Considerations**: The upgrade should follow the detailed plan in `v5.md`. Key challenges include:
        - The message system overhaul (DB, API, client).
        - Ensuring all tool definitions and MCP integrations are correctly updated.
        - Thorough testing due to the "Alpha" nature of the SDK.
    **Dependencies**: As listed in `<newDependencies>`.
    **Security Considerations**: No new direct security considerations beyond standard practices, but ensure any new SDK features (like `experimental_prepareStep` if used with dynamic inputs) are handled securely.

    ## Testing Approach

    **Test Cases**: (Refer to Section VIII in `v5.md`)
        - Core chat API functionality.
        - Message persistence and retrieval (new messages).
        - MCP tool integration (all tools).
        - Agent interactions.
        - Public chat sharing page.
    **Acceptance Criteria**:
        - All tests pass.
        - Application is stable and performs as expected.
        - All core features are functional using AI SDK v5 Alpha.
    **Edge Cases**: Error handling in `streamText`, tool execution failures, network issues during SSE streaming.
    **Performance Requirements**: Maintain or improve existing performance benchmarks for chat response time and tool execution.

    ## Design Assets

    N/A for this backend-focused upgrade, unless UI rendering of `UIMessage.parts` requires design changes.

    ## Future Considerations

    **Scalability Plans**: AI SDK v5 is designed for more complex agentic behavior, which could improve scalability of advanced features.
    **Enhancement Ideas**: Leverage new v5 features like `prepareStep`, `continueUntil`, and structured data streaming for richer chat interactions post-migration.
    **Known Limitations**: The AI SDK is in Alpha; features are subject to change. Monitor official Vercel AI SDK releases and documentation closely.
