# Prisma Workflow

This document outlines the standard procedures for managing the database schema, client, and data seeding using Prisma.

## 1. Modifying the Schema

All database schema changes must be made in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file. This is the single source of truth for your database models.

## 2. Generating the Prisma Client

After you modify the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, you must regenerate the Prisma Client to update the types and available methods.

Run the following command:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh prisma-generate
```

The Prisma Client is located in `node_modules/@prisma/client`.

## 3. Creating Database Migrations

For any schema change that needs to be persisted to the database, you must create a migration.

To create a new migration, run:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh prisma-migrate-dev --name <your-migration-name>
```

Replace `<your-migration-name>` with a short, descriptive name for your migration in kebab-case (e.g., `add-user-model`). This command will:
1.  Create a new SQL migration file in `prisma/migrations/`.
2.  Apply the migration to your development database.
3.  Ensure the Prisma Client is in sync.

## 4. Seeding the Database

The project contains a seed script at `prisma/seed.ts` to populate the database with initial data. To run it, use the command defined in `package.json` and `dev.sh`:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh prisma db seed
```

You can modify the `prisma/seed.ts` file to change the seed data.
